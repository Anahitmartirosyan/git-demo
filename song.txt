We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves

Where our eyes are never closing 
Hearts are never broken

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

Hm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
